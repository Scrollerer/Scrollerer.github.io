## Description 
This is an overview of some of my programming projects since 2015.  

All of the projects have been done with immense passion, countless hours of debugging, and letting my creativity run free to achieve success, perfection, and complete fulfillment—satisfaction and even tears of happiness.  

By gamifying my projects, I dig deep into the logic behind each dynamic to understand, learn, and keep my love for programming alive, making learning new languages more exciting and every success incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.

## TIA Portal v19 - PLC & HMI (LD)

**Projects Overview:**

- **Snake Game**
>  <img src="include/Snake_PLC.gif" alt="Animated GIF Snake Game PLC" width="50%"> 
> 
> In the first semester of my education without any previous experience I tested the limits of the 1215C CPU and KTP700 Basic HMI using Ladder logic and recreated the classical Snake game. It features difficulty modes, levels, and multiplayer mode between two HMIs and PLCs using Get/Put commands. 
> 
> I was inspired to recreate this game by nostalgic childhood memories of playing Snake on my Gameboy. The fact that there were no tutorials/videos/documentation on the internet about someone achieving this in TIA using Ladder Logic made this project extra challenging, but also extremely fulfilling in the end.


- **2 Player Whack-a-Mole Game**
> <img src="include/whack-a-mole.gif" alt="Animated GIF Whack-a-mole" width="50%">  
>
> Using only one PLC and two HMIs to create a game where your reflexes are put to the test. Two players compete in tapping as many moles as possible within one minute to define the winner.
>
> The art is created in paint and inspired by Pokémon, one of my favorite animations I used to watch as a child. The inspiration for creating the game came from playing a real Whack-a-Mole on a date I recently had with my girlfriend.


- **Box Washer Prototype**
> <img src="include/Box_Washer_Prototype.gif" alt="Animated GIF loading game" width="90%">  
> 
> As a finishing first-semester project, I had to create a program and design an HMI for a customer's prototype Box Washer. It features six different screens with advanced animations, timers, and indicators. I felt a great sense of accomplishment after drawing the 2D model for the machine, designing the HMI screens, and programming the logic - completely from scratch.
>
> The freedom to create everything from scratch by letting my imagination and creativity run freely made the completion of this project deeply fulfilling when I saw all parts working together as a whole. 


- **FESTO Stations - Sorting and Processing**
> <img src="include/FESTO.gif" alt="Animated GIF loading game" width="90%">  
> 
> As a finishing second-semester project, I had to learn how the two stations work, troubleshoot, and modify their code so they can communicate and work together, and design an HMI. The HMI makes it possible to manually interact with each component on the Station, as well as, seeing all the processes live under both stations' automatic operation. The two stations communicate using GET/PUT commands.
> 
> Being given a task to understand an unknown machine without any guidance was challenging, but it was exactly what made me feel a deep sense of accomplishment once I figured it out.

## Thonny (Python)

**Projects Overview:**

- **Warehouse Worker Prototype**
>  <img src="include/loadcat.gif" alt="Animated GIF Warehouse PicoGo" width="10%"> 
> 
> Using the PicoGo v2 robot and manipulating almost all of its sensors with Python, I made a prototype for it to be the perfect warehouse worker, or a Roomba if you attach a vacuum to it... 
> 
> It features line tracking, obstacle avoidance and both manual and automatic modes. Using the manual mode, you can assign a station using the remote control, and the robot will get to that station, deload, and return to the starting station. Using Automatic mode, you just press start on the remote and it assigns a random station to go to, then it returns to the starting station, and it does the same thing over and over again, until the battery dies or you stop it.


- **Self Playing Snake game**
> <img src="include/loadcat.gif" alt="Animated GIF SnakeGame PicoGo" width="10%">  
> 
> Using a little 1.14-inch LCD, Raspberry Pi Pico, Python, and the lack of buttons pushed me in the direction to make the Snake game play on its own. It works well as an entertaining screensaver.
> 
> Right after creating the snake game for PLC (Further up in the portfolio), I thought I would challenge myself to make it in Python too. Due to the lack of buttons on the PicoGo robot, I had to make it play on its own. I could technically use its IR sensors to control the snake.

- **ZigZag**
> <img src="include/ZigZagGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF ZigZag Unity" width="50%"> 
>
> **Description:** Challenge yourself by zig-zagging and avoid falling off the platform.
> 
> Being one of the most popular games in the App Store and looking pretty simple, I decided to challenge myself and recreate it. Finishing this game inspired me to do more projects in the iOS environment.

> 
> It might not look like much, but when I finished this project and added the music, it made me emotional.


- **RPG Idle Collector**
> <img src="include/RPGGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF RPG Unity" width="50%"> 
> 
> **Description:** Upgrade your collector and see how fast you can make it.
> 
> This type of game was on top of the charts when I got inspired to recreate it. I had a deep urge to break down the logic and understand it on a deeper level - and so I did!
