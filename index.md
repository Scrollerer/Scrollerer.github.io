## Description 
This is an overview of some of my programming projects since 2015.  
All of the projects have been done with immense passion, countless hours of debugging, and letting my creativity run free to achieve success, perfection, and complete fulfillmentâ€”satisfaction and even tears of happiness.  
By gamifying my projects, I dig deep into the logic behind each dynamic to understand, learn, and keep my love for programming alive, making learning new languages more exciting and every success incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.

## TIA Portal v19 - PLC & HMI (LD)

**Projects Overview:**

- Snake Game
>  <img src="include/loadcat.gif" alt="Animated GIF loading game" width="15%"> 
>
> (uploading preview soon)
> 
> Already in the first semester of my education without any previous experience I tested the limits of the 1215C CPU and KTP700 Basic HMI using Ladder logic and recreated the classical Snake game. It features difficulty modes, levels and multiplayer mode between two HMIs and PLCs using Get/Put commands. 
>
> My inspiration for recreating this game was brought up the nostalgic moments of my childhood of me playing Snake on my Gameboy. The fact that there was no tutorials/videos/documentation on the internet about someone achieving this in TIA using Ladder Logic made this project extra challenging, but also extremely satisfactory in the end.


- 2 Player Whack-a-Mole Game
> <img src="include/whack-a-mole.gif" alt="Animated GIF Whack-a-mole" width="30%">  
>
> Using only one PLC and two HMIs to create a game where your reflexes are put to the test. Two players compete in tapping as many moles as possible within one minute to define the winner.
>
> The art is created in paint and inspired by Pokemon - one of my favorite animations I used to watch as a child. The inspiration for creating the game came from playing a real Whack-a-Mole on a date I had recently with my girlfriend.


- Box Washer Prototype
> <img src="include/loadcat.gif" alt="Animated GIF loading game" width="15%">  
>
> (uploading preview soon)
> 
> As a finishing first-semester project, I had to create a program and design an HMI for a customer's prototype Box Washer. It features six different screens with advanced animations, timers, and indicators. I felt a great sense of accomplishment after drawing the 2D model for the machine, designing the HMI screens and programming the logic - completely from scratch.
>
> The freedom to create everything from scratch by letting my imagination and creativity run freely, made the completion of this project deeply fulfilling when I saw all parts working together as a whole. 


- FESTO Stations - Sorting and Processing 
> <img src="include/loadcat.gif" alt="Animated GIF loading game" width="15%">  
>
> (uploading preview soon)
> 
> As a finishing second-semester project, I had to learn how the two stations work, troubleshoot, and modify their code so they can communicate and work together and design an HMI. The HMI makes it possible to manually interact with each component on the Station, as well as, seeing all the processes live under both stations' automatic operation.
> 
> Being given a task to understand an unknown machine without any guidance was challenging, but it was exactly what made me feel a deep sense of accomplishment once I figured it out.

## Unity (C#)

**Projects Overview:**

- **Color Switch Dash**
>  <img src="include/SwitchColorGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF ColorSwitch Unity" width="30%"> 
> 
> **Description:** See how long you can go by jumping over, going under, switching colors, and going through obstacles. 
> 
> I have always wanted to create a mobile game ever since I was a kid. I finally accomplished that and the kid in me is crying happy tears now.


- ZigZag
> <img src="include/ZigZagGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF ZigZag Unity" width="30%"> 
>
> **Description:** Challenge yourself by zig-zagging and avoid falling off the platform.
> 
> Being one of the most popular games in the AppStore and looking pretty simple, I decided to challenge myself and recreate it. Finishing this game, inspired me to do more projects in the iOS environment.


- Arena Shape Shooter
> <img src="include/ShooterGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF Shooter Unity" width="90%"> 
> 
> Shoot down waves of enemies in an arena.
> 
> After playing for many hours on diep.io with my friends, I decided to challenge myself and make my own version of it.


- Balance
> <img src="include/BallGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF Ball Unity" width="90%"> 
> 
> Balance a ball through challenging levels and obstacles.
> 
> When I was a kid, I used to watch my parents play the famous game "Balance" back in the early 2000s, so I've got inspired to recreate it and make my own style and levels.



- Immersive Game Menu
> <img src="include/SurviveMenuGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF Survive Unity" width="90%"> 
> 
> Inspired by my passion for survival games and my favorite game Outer Wilds, I created a survival environment and made a menu that uses it for more immersiveness.
> 
> It might not look like much, but when I finished this project and added the music, it brought up tears in my eyes.


- RPG Idle Collector
> <img src="include/RPGGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF RPG Unity" width="30%"> 
> 
> Upgrade your collector and see how fast you can make it.
> 
> This type of game was on top of the charts when I got inspired to recreate it. I had a deep urge to break down the logic and understand it on a deeper level - and so I did!

## CMD (C++)

**Projects Overview:**

- Survival game
>  <img src="include/SurviveGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF Menu Unity" width="90%"> 
>
> A survival game where you need to survive as long as you can by taking life-depending decisions. It features custom made sounds, animations and ASCII art
> 
> This game was the BEGINNING of my programming journey back in 2015. I have no words to describe how many times I've got goosebumps by getting an imaginative idea, planning it, and succesfully programming it inside the game to turn it into a reality. Truly my favorite project of them all!


- Puzzle game
> <img src="include/PuzzleGif.gif" alt="Animated GIF Menu Unity" width="90%"> 
>
> Move objects, collect keys, solve puzzles, and open doors to reach the next level without getting stuck.
> 
> Challenging myself to move a player model inside the console (CMD) and interacting with objects was my first introduction to creating 2D graphics and games.

> When I used to go to primary school I had a classmate who didn't have a watch, so he was constantly asking me how much time there is left until the end of school. There you go Philip!
